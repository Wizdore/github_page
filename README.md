# [Freezenet: Neural Network watermarking System](https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/ds_salary_proj) 
This system allows an user to train a neural network with a digital signature. The neural network model can later be licensed and distributed with the signature. Redistributed neural network can be identified with this system to prevent illegal copying of the model. The embedded signature can also be used as a proof of work in neural network training based crypto currency mining.
